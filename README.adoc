== What is the intended use of this program?

* It is a simple GTK application to crop JPEG images using Python by selecting a cropping area and saving a copy.
* Unlike general purpose image manipulation programs it avoids https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_loss[generation loss].

Short, non-technical explanation: +
Digital images are made up of tiny dots called pixels. These pixels are
arranged in groups. If you cut an image along the lines between these groups,
you can save the image without losing quality. This is because you don't have
to redo the whole image.

Technical explanation:

[quote,https://github.com/jepler/cropgui/]
____
It turns out that debian's jpegtran has a "-crop" flag which performs lossless
cropping of jpeg images as long as the crop is to a multiple of what the
manpage calls the "iMCU boundary", usually an 8x8 or 16x16 block of pixels.
This feature may have been pioneered by Guido of jpegclub.org some years ago.

[WARNING]
====
This is an attempt to re-implement an already existing solution:

https://github.com/jepler/cropgui/

I wanted to avoid executing non-standard installer scripts on my new Linux installations.
After looking around for alternative solutions or how the repository could be
improved, I decided to start with a new project.

This script does not have feature parity yet.
====

=== Supported formats

* JPEG

It's just a simple GUI around JPEGtran at the moment.
Eventually it will support other popular formats.

== Installation

=== Option A: Pipx

This installation method is currently preferred.

First you will need to install the link:#dependencies[] for your platform.

Given that you have already installed Python and
https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/[pipx]
you can install the application using pipx like this:

[source,bash]
----
pipx install git+https://github.com/lwbt/CropGuiNeu.git
----

=== Option B: Flatpak

This application is in development and will eventually be available on Flathub.
Until then, you must manually clone the repository and build it using the SDK.

[source,bash]
----
flatpak --user install \
  org.gnome.Platform/x86_64/46
  org.gnome.Sdk/x86_64/46 \

flatpak-builder \
  --force-clean build-dir "io.github.lwbt.CropGuiNeu.yaml"
flatpak-builder \
  --user \
  --install \
  --force-clean build-dir "io.github.lwbt.CropGuiNeu.yaml"
----

The Flatpak version is unable to access EXIF metadata because it lacks the necessary Perl dependency for `exiftool`.
This functionality will be implemented differently for the Flathub release.

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
$ crop_gui_neu --help
usage: crop_gui_neu [-h] [image]

Crop a JPEG image using a GUI.

positional arguments:
  image       Path to the JPEG image to crop
----

If you installed the application through Flatpak you should be able to run it with:

[source,bash]
----
flatpak --user run io.github.lwbt.CropGuiNeu
----

== Dependencies

Currently the script requires the following external progams to be installed:

* `exiftool`
* `jpegtran`

*Ubuntu/Debian:*

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libjpeg-turbo-progs libimage-exiftool-perl
----

*Fedora:*

[source,bash]
----
sudo dnf install -y libjpeg-turbo-utils perl-Image-ExifTool
----

*Arch Linux:*

[source,bash]
----
sudo pacman -S exiftool libjpeg-turbo
----

*macOS using Homebrew:*

[source,bash]
----
brew install exiftool libjpeg-turbo
----
