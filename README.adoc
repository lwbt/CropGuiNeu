== What is the intended use of this program?

This application is:

* A simple GTK application to crop JPEG images by selecting a cropping area and saving a copy of the image.
* Unlike general purpose image manipulation programs it avoids https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_loss[generation loss].

For more information see: link:FAQ.adoc#why-build-it[]

*Short, non-technical explanation:* +
Digital images are made up of tiny dots called pixels. These pixels are
arranged in groups. If you cut an image along the lines between these groups,
you can save the image without losing quality. This is because you don't have
to redo the whole image.

Technical explanation:

[quote,https://github.com/jepler/cropgui/]
____
It turns out that debian's jpegtran has a "-crop" flag which performs lossless
cropping of jpeg images as long as the crop is to a multiple of what the
manpage calls the "iMCU boundary", usually an 8x8 or 16x16 block of pixels.
This feature may have been pioneered by Guido of jpegclub.org some years ago.

=== Supported formats

* JPEG

It's just a simple GUI around JPEGtran at the moment.
Eventually it will support other popular formats.

== Installation

This application is in development and will eventually be available for Linux on Flathub.

=== Option A: Flatpak bundle via GitHub releases

.Download a bundle and install it:
[source,bash]
----
flatpak --user install CropGuiNeu-*-TESTING-*.flatpak
----

=== Option B: Flatpak, build it yourself

You can manually clone the repository and build it using the SDK.
The `Makefile` contains all required instructions to build it yourself.

.Just run:
[source,bash]
----
make

flatpak --user install CropGuiNeu-*-TESTING-*.flatpak
----

=== Option C: Pipx/UV

This installation method was previously preferred.
If you can't use Flatpak, like on a Mac, you can still use Pipx/UV and install the dependencies.

First you will need to install the link:#dependencies[] for your platform.

Given that you have already installed Python and
https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/[Pipx]
you can install the application using pipx like this:

[source,bash]
----
pipx install git+https://github.com/lwbt/CropGuiNeu.git
----

==== Dependencies

Currently the script requires the following external progams to be installed:

* `jpegtran` -- This program provides the functionality around which the GUI is built.

*Ubuntu/Debian:*

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libjpeg-turbo-progs
----

*Fedora:*

[source,bash]
----
sudo dnf install -y libjpeg-turbo-utils
----

*Arch Linux:*

[source,bash]
----
sudo pacman -S libjpeg-turbo
----

*macOS using Homebrew:*

[source,bash]
----
brew install libjpeg-turbo
----

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
$ crop_gui_neu --help
usage: crop_gui_neu [-h] [image]

Crop a JPEG image using a GUI.

positional arguments:
  image       Path to the JPEG image to crop
----

If you installed the application through Flatpak you should be able to run it with:

[source,bash]
----
flatpak --user run io.github.lwbt.CropGuiNeu
----
