== General

=== Why did you choose this name?

_"Neu"_ is German for _"new"_.

I was looking for a short and descriptive name.
It isn't the most creative name and it sounds a bit awkward, but so does  _"Helvetica Neue"_.
If anyone wants to create a better tool, please do, I left _"Crop GUI Neo"_ free just for you.

=== Installer Script

The original installation script for https://github.com/jepler/cropgui/[Crop GUI]
is a bit difficult to read and understand.
I made a new version which also includes an uninstall option.

*Important:*
This script is for the _old_ version of Crop GUI by jepler.
My version uses either Pipx or Flatpak for installation.

You can find the script here:
