== General

=== Why did you choose this name?

_"Neu"_ is German for _"new"_.

I was looking for a short and descriptive name.
It isn't the most creative name and it sounds a bit awkward, but so does  _"Helvetica Neue"_.
If anyone wants to create a better tool, please do, I left _"Crop GUI Neo"_ free just for you.

=== Why build it?

This is an attempt to re-implement an already existing solution:
https://github.com/jepler/cropgui/

I wanted to avoid executing non-standard installer scripts on my new Linux installations.
After looking around for alternative solutions or how the repository could be
improved, I decided to start with a new project.

This script does not have feature parity yet.

At first, it looked like an easy project, until I tried to replace `exiftool`
and pulled in a lot of dependencies for what was just a little Perl script.
I will eventually rewrite parts when I learn new languages, but don't expect
this to be completed any time soon.

=== Installer Script

The original installation script for Crop GUI is a bit difficult to read and
understand. I made a new version which also includes an uninstall option.

*Important:*
This script is for the _old_ version of Crop GUI by jepler.
My version uses either Pipx or Flatpak for installation.

You can find the script here:
link:/assets/cropgui_install.sh[]

The style if the script is defined by `shfmt` in pre-commit with a few
parameters that I prefer.

== Development

=== Building with Flatpak

Dependencies:

* `python3-requirement-parser` on Ubuntu to run `flatpak-pip-generator.py` with Pip.
* `python3-toml` on Ubuntu to run `flatpak-poetry-generator.py` with Poetry.
